 * Testcase Example:  '3\n7'
 *
 * There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the
 * top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the
 * bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move
 * either down or right at any point in time.
 *
 * Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths
 * that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.
 *
 * The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal
 * to 2 * 10^9.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: m = 3, n = 7
 * Output: 28
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: m = 3, n = 2
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach
 * the bottom-right corner:
 * 1. Right -> Down -> Down
 * 2. Down -> Down -> Right
 * 3. Down -> Right -> Down
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= m, n <= 100
